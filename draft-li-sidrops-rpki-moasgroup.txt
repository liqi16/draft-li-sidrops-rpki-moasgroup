         A Profile for RPKI Signed Group of Multiple-Origin AS
                 draft-li-sidrops-rpki-moasgroup-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a "Signed MOAS Group", a Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to authenticate the collective announcement
   of IP prefixes by multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes).  The Signed
   MOAS Group includes two parts: an IP prefix and a list of ASes
   authorized to announce the prefix.  At least one of these ASes SHOULD
   be authorized to announce the prefix by the prefix owner through a
   Route Origin Authorization (ROA).  The IP prefix in the ROA must
   match the IP prefix in the Signed MOAS Group, and the ASN in the ROA
   must appear in the AS list.  The validation of a Signed MOAS Group
   confirms that the authenticated AS and the listed ASes have
   collectively agreed to announce the prefix, ensuring that the
   announcement is legitimate, accurate, and consensually authorized.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a "Signed MOAS Group", a Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] [RFC626] protected content type to carry an IP
   prefix and a list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) authorized to announce
   this prefix.  The Signed MOAS Group allows multiple ASes to
   collaboratively and securely announce an IP prefix, supporting
   scenarios such as business partnerships, IP address transfers, and
   DDoS protection services.

   At least one ASes in the AS list SHOULD be authorized to announce the
   prefix by the prefix owner through a Route Origin Authorization
   (ROA).  The IP prefix in the ROA must match the IP prefix in the
   Signed MOAS Group, and the ASN in the ROA must appear in the AS list.
   The content is collectively signed by the authorized ASes using a
   multi-signature technique, and the aggregated global signature is
   attached by the authenticated AS.  This ensures that the announcement
   is endorsed by all participating ASes and is verifiable by any RPKI-
   validating remote routing entities.

   To validate a MoasGroup object, a relying party (RP) aggregates the
   public keys of all ASes in the AS list into a global public key,
   which is then used to verify the Signed MOAS Group.  If the Signed
   MOAS Group is verified and a corresponding ROA is found, the MOAS
   Group is considered valid.  If the Signed MOAS Group is verified but
   no corresponding ROA is found, it is considered suspicious.  If the
   Signed MOAS Group cannot be verified, it is considered invalid.

   The Signed MOAS Group provides a mechanism for securely managing
   multi-origin AS announcements, offering a robust and flexible
   solution to handle modern routing requirements.  Any prefixes
   announced by ASes that are not included in a ROA or a validated
   Signed MOAS Group SHOULD be regarded as suspicious, though their
   handling is subject to local routing policies.  The intent is to
   offer a secure and authenticated method for managing MOAS scenarios,
   enhancing the overall security and integrity of the routing system.
